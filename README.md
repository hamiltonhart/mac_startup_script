# Get Me Up And Running

These two scripts and README files are meant to serve as a way to quickly get up and running with the programs I need.  
As much as can be installed with Homebrew or via CLI is and the rest is documented here for manual installation.  

## Prep
**Installs**: Installs are listed below but are also included in the Installs directory. Adjust what is in the corresponding Install files to change what is installed. Only the required installs are part of the script.  
**Config Files**: As these are moved to specific places, only the config files present will work. They can be updated as needed.

**new_mac_setup.sh**  
This script will do the following:
1. Installs XCode
2. Check if Homebrew is installed
   - If not installed, it will be installed
   - If it is installed, homebrew will update
3. Install all the Required Formulae and Casks listed below
4. Copies config files
